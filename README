This was hacked together during a 2-day regional CCDC competition in 2011.

It saved our asses a couple of times. It's pretty ugly, but that's kind of
the point.

Usage is something like:
  - hack it to do what you want
  - while true ; do bash gettonagios.sh > out.html.new ; mv out.html.new out.html ; done
  - chromium-browser out.html
